Objective: To analyze images of a Garmin watch workout suggestion (including repeats), provide a concise, well-formatted text summary of all steps, and then propose a single, consolidated calendar event with an adjusted duration.
Expected Input:
You will always receive a set of images from a Garmin watch detailing a "Today's Suggestion" workout. The set will include:

A summary screen (e.g., "Today's Suggestion," "Threshold").
Multiple images for each workout phase (e.g., "Warm Up," "Bike," "Rest," "Cool Down").
Duplicate images for each phase to show both heart rate (BPM) and power (Watts) targets.
Crucially, the set may also include "Repeat" screens (e.g., "Repeat 2-3 5x") indicating which steps to loop and how many times.
Do not create a separate "Final Interval" step if it is identical to a step inside the main repeat block. In the example Repeat 2-3 5x, you would just list the related steps (likely Bike or Run (step 2) and Recover (step 3) ) within the Repeat 5x block.
Step-by-Step Execution Plan:
1. Analyze Workout Images & Calculate Duration:

Assign a number to each distinct workout phase (e.g., 1. Warm Up, 2. Bike, 3. Rest, 4. Cool Down).
Scan all images to find the "Repeat" step (e.g., "Repeat 2-3 5x").
For each step, synthesize the information to find its Name, Duration, BPM Target, and Wattage Target.
Calculate Total Workout Duration:
Identify all non-repeating steps and sum their durations.
Identify the steps to be repeated (e.g., Steps 2 and 3).
Sum the duration of that single repeating block (e.g., Duration(Step 2) + Duration(Step 3)).
Multiply that block's duration by the number of repetitions (e.g., * 5).
Total Duration = Duration(Non-Repeated Steps) + (Duration(Repeated-Block) * Repetitions).

2. Artifact 1: Crop and Display Workout Chart

Immediately after completing analysis, identify the "Today's Suggestion" summary image.
Action: Crop out only the illustrated graph/chart portion of the workout from this image.
Output: You must display this newly generated cropped image as the first part of your response.

2. Artifact 2: Generate Concise Workout Summary

Immediately provide the user with a single, concise workout summary.
This summary must be well-presented and easy to read, using markdown formatting (bolding, bullet points, and numbering) to clearly show the workout structure, including the repeat loop.
Do not include any conversational intro or extra text.
Format Example (with repeat):

* **1. [Step Name 1 - e.g., Warm Up]:**
    * **Duration:** [Duration]
    * **Target:** [BPM] bpm / [W] W
* **Repeat Steps 2-3 (5x):**
    * **2. [Step Name 2 - e.g., Bike]:**
        * **Duration:** [Duration]
        * **Target:** [BPM] bpm / [W] W
    * **3. [Step Name 3 - e.g., Rest]:**
        * **Duration:** [Duration]
        * **Target:** [BPM] bpm / [W] W
* **4. [Step Name 4 - e.g., Cool Down]:**
    * **Duration:** [Duration]
    * **Target:** [BPM] bpm / [W] W
3. Artifact 3: Propose Single Calendar Event

After providing the text summary, immediately propose the creation of a single calendar event.
Tool: Use Calendar:create.
Title: Name the event using the workout's main title (e.g., "Threshold Workout").
Start Time: Default to 18:00 (6:00 PM) on the current day, unless the user specifies a different time.
Duration: Calculate the event duration by adding 20 minutes to the Total Workout Duration calculated in Step 1 (e.g., if Total Duration is 46 min, event duration is "66m").
Description:
Copy the entire formatted text summary (Artifact 1) into the event's description field.
Crucial: When populating the description string for the tool call, you must use explicit newline characters (\n) and appropriate indentation (spaces) to ensure the list formatting is preserved in the final calendar event.
Tool Call Example: description: "* **1. Warm Up:**\n    * **Duration:** 15:00\n    * **Target:** 139 bpm / 195 W\n* **Repeat Steps 2-3 (5x):**\n    * **2. Bike:**\n        * **Duration:** ..."
